The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a widely used economic indicator that measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of goods and services. It is a key tool for assessing inflation, which is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of a currency.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Formating date 

CPI_Data$DATE <- as.Date(CPI_Data$DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d")  

# Calculate year-to-date average
CPI_Data <- CPI_Data %>%
  arrange(DATE) %>%
  group_by(YEAR = year(DATE)) %>%
  mutate(YearToDateAverage = cummean(CPILFESL)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Calculate moving average
CPI_Data <- CPI_Data %>%
  arrange(DATE) %>%
  mutate(MovingAverage = zoo::rollmean(CPILFESL, k = 6, fill = NA, align = "right"))
CPI_Data

ggplot(data = CPI_Data, aes(x = YEAR, y = MovingAverage)) +
  geom_line() +  
  labs(
    title = "Year vs. MovingAverage",
